  <h1>Why do I like hackclub?</h1>
  <p> Of course, rewards have something to do with it. I like it because it motivates me to program. I stopped programming in Python a while ago, I got discouraged, and I feel more incapable. But this motivates me to face that and, inevitably, at least try, make mistakes, and learn. </p>
